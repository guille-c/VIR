This code was originally written between 2005 and 2008. It implements the Bayesian Interferometric Reconstruction Based on Voronoi Diagrams described [in this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.4140). This particular implementation works for the Cosmic Background Imager ([CBI](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/CBI/)) but it is extendable to any other interferometer. Makefiles are hard coded for the original server where the program was compiled and run, hence creation of configuration files is needed.

A detailed explanation of the code organization can be found in my [MSc. thesis](docs/Msc_Thesis_gcabrera.pdf).
